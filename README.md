## Silver Chariot Club

This project is a website prototype for a fictional youth hockey organization called **Silver Chariot Club**.
It was built to practice using the **DDD design system** and **Lit components** covered in class.

The site includes a few basic pages such as **Home**, **Schedule**, **News**, and **Information**, with simple routing handled through URL parameters.

All styling (colors, fonts, spacing, and layout) follows DDD design tokens to keep everything consistent.
Menu and schedule data are loaded from Vercel API endpoints to simulate real data usage.

The project is fully component-based and designed to work on both desktop and mobile screens.
